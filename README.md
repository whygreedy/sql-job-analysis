# Background

To refine my SQL skill, data storytelling skill and prepare for job hunting in data analyst roles, I've discovered a project within an [online course](https://youtu.be/7mz73uXD9DA?si=f16EWPUbsigblMZy) that aligns perfectly with my goals. Special thanks to Luke Barousse, I learned a lot from your course.

Data hails from Luke Barousse's [SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql). It's packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

> The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?
6. What are the salary stats for top demanded or top paying skills required for Data Analyst Jobs?

# Tools I Used

To delve into the data analyst job market, I leveraged the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Using Jupyter Notebook in VS Code along with Pandas, seaborn, and Matplotlib to analyze and visualize query result data in Python.
- **Pandas:** To load and manipulate data, and then integrate with Matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.
- **Matplotlib:** To plot bar chart.
- **seaborn:** To plot scatter plot and boxplot.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.

# The Analysis

## Highlights

Before diving into step-by-step analysis, here are data graphs with insights for you to quickly capture the highlights of this project.

**1. Salary Stats Overview**

- Annual salary stats of all Data Analyst Jobs:

  | Stats              | Annual Salary (USD) |
  | ------------------ | ------------------- |
  | Q1 25th percentile | 75,000              |
  | Median             | 92,500              |
  | Q3 75th percentile | 111,478             |
  | Mean               | 96,707              |
  | Max                | 400,000             |
  | Min                | 30,000              |

- Data Analyst roles typically provide competitive salaries that can support a comfortable standard of living in the US. Besides, the 75% of jobs offer annual salary above $75,000 which is beyond U.S. median annual income $59,540 in 2023 Q4.

**2. Salary Stats of Top 5 Demanded Skills**

- The median salary (represented by the horizontal line inside each box) varies across top demanded skills, and Python appears to have the highest median salary, followed by Tableau and R.
- As a junior data analyst job seeker, being proficient in Python and Tableau could enhance your job prospects and potentially lead to better salary opportunities.

![7_top_demanded_skill_salary](datagraph/7_top_demanded_skill_salary.png)

**3. Salary Stats of Top 5 Paying Skills**

- Skills relevant to big data, distributed data management and machine learning obtain high-paying jobs.
- Kafka and PyTorch have higher Q3 and mean salary among top 5 paying skills despite their median value not being the highest. Job seekers with proficiency in these skills may have access to a subset of high-paying jobs that offer competitive salaries above the median and mean of the entire job listings.

![7_top_paying_skill_salary](datagraph/7_top_paying_skill_salary.png)

**4. Optimal Skills Analysis**

From previous highlights, we analyzed top 5 demanded and top 5 paying skills and their salary stats. Now, we look into optimal skills (top 25 paying skills that have over 10 job listings) while applying the concept of [BCG Matrix](https://www.bcg.com/about/overview/our-history/growth-share-matrix) to analyze top skills and make strategy to develop our skillset.

Among top 25 paying skills that have over 10 job listings:

> **High Demand, High Salary (Star):**\
> Airflow, Scala, Linux, Confluence, PySpark\
> **High Demand, Low Salary (Cash cow):**\
> Snowflake, Spark, Hadoop, Databricks, pandas, GCP, Git\
> **Low Demand, Low Salary (Pet):**\
> MongoDB, Splunk, Shell, Unix, phoenix, PHP\
> **Low Demand, High Salary (Question mark):**\
> Kafka, PyTorch, Perl, TensorFlow, Cassandra, Atlassian

- Despite skills like Kafka, PyTorch, Perl, TensorFlow and Cassandra tend to be high-paying, their demands on market are not as many as skills in Star and Cash cow quadrants.

- Rather than finding either top demanded skills or top paying skills, we could develop our skillset strategy to pave the career in data analysis field.

- As a junior Data Analyst, I want to prioritize which optimal skills to learn or enhance based on not only my interest but also the degree of financial stability and prospect. First, I would enhance my skills on Hadoop, pandas to get financial stability. And then, I would invest myself to extend skillset on Spark, PySpark, Snowflake and Airflow for obtaining higher paying and sought-after jobs.

![5_optimal_skills](datagraph/5_optimal_skills.png)

**5. Skills Required for Top 10 Paying Jobs**

- Among top 10 paying jobs, Python is the most common skill and followed by Tableau, Excel, R and SQL.

- A combination of languages (Python, SQL, R), data visualization tools (Tableau, Power BI, Looker), big data tools (BigQuery, Kafka, Snowflake), and version control systems (Git, GitHub) are highly valued in data analyst roles.
