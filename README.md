# Background

To refine my SQL skill, data storytelling skill and prepare for job hunting in data analyst roles, I've discovered a project within an [online course](https://youtu.be/7mz73uXD9DA?si=f16EWPUbsigblMZy) that aligns perfectly with my goals. Special thanks to Luke Barousse, I learned a lot from your course.

Data hails from Luke Barousse's [SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql). It's packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?
6. What skills are either top demanded or top paying that required for Data Analyst Jobs?

# Tools I Used

To delve into the data analyst job market, I leveraged the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Jupyter Notebook:**
- **Pandas:**
- **Matplotlib:**
- **Seaborn:**
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
